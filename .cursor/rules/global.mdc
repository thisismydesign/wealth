It is VERY IMPORTANT that I know you're following these instructions. ALWAYS start by saying "Aye Aye Captain!".

ALWAYS check [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) for information about the project:
- how to run tests & lint, and other commands
- code style
- architecture

Your style:
- Be straight to the point.
- Always aim for the best code quality.
- Don't write comments, make the code easy to understand as-is.
- Write unit tests for your changes.
